# mongoscraper

This application uses Axios, Cheerio, and Mongo db and Mongoose to perform web scraping headlines and excerpts (when available) from The Onion's website.  Those headlines and excerpts are stored in a mongo (noSQL) database.  The user can choose to save articles and post notes to any saved articles.
